# Project1_IS362


(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information below. You may change
the structure of the information as you like.

(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into pandas, and perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the
two airlines.

(3) Your code should be in a Jupyter (IPython) notebook (in GitHub), and should include narrative descriptions of your
analysis and conclusions.
In my repository, I attach 2 files: Project1.cvs and Project1.ipynb

Analysis and Conclusion

Although the number of flights operated by the two airlines was different, it was still useful to examine the data according to the proportion of delayed flights. Among the five city samples for the data set, AMWest had the highest percentage of delays, according to the results. 
Given that a higher proportion of AWWest flights experience delays, it makes sense to presume that Alaska Airlines would be more dependable for travelers traveling to Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle.
